# Hybrid Kalman Filter for Stock Market Prediction

## Overview 

This repository implements a **Hybrid Kalman Filter**, a powerful tool that combines the classical Kalman Filter with deep learning to predict stock market prices or other noisy time-series data. Designed for Python programmers and machine learning enthusiasts, it provides a robust framework for modeling complex, non-linear dynamics in financial markets. The repo serves as an educational and practical resource, demonstrating how to blend traditional signal processing with neural networks for real-world applications. 
  
## Why This Repository Exists       
  
The stock market is a noisy, dynamic system, challenging to predict with traditional or purely machine learning-based methods. The Hybrid Kalman Filter addresses this by leveraging the Kalman Filter's state estimation and neural networks' ability to learn non-linear patterns. This repo exists to:    
  
- Provide a working implementation of a Hybrid Kalman Filter tailored for stock market prediction.   
- Offer educational content explaining the model's mechanics and significance.     
- Inspire developers to adapt the approach to other time-series tasks, such as sensor data or weather forecasting.     

## Repository Contents    
  
The repository contains a single folder, `hybrid_filter`, with three files:    
    
- **`hybrid_filter.py`**: The core Python script implementing the Hybrid Kalman Filter. It includes:  
  - `DeepKalmanNetwork`: A PyTorch neural network for learning state transitions, observations, and noise. 
  - `HybridKalmanFilter`: Combines the neural network with Kalman Filter logic.
  - `StockMarketPredictor`: Handles data preprocessing, training, and prediction.
  - A demonstration function to test the model on synthetic stock data.

- **`walkthrough.txt`**: A detailed yet concise educational guide explaining the `hybrid_filter.py` code. Aimed at programmers familiar with Python and machine learning, it breaks down each component, its purpose, and how it works, making the model accessible and adaptable.

- **`why_a_hybrid_kalman_filter.txt`**: An eloquent diatribe on the Hybrid Kalman Filter's strengths for stock market and noisy time-series prediction. Targeted at university graduates, it highlights the model's theoretical and practical advantages, encouraging real-world application of machine learning skills.

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**: Python 3.8+, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib.
2. **Installation**: Clone the repo and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rhapsodic-legacy/hybrid_kalman__stock_price_prediction.git
   pip install torch numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib


Usage: Run hybrid_filter.py to train and test the model on synthetic data. Modify it to use real stock data (e.g., from Kaggle) by following the instructions in the script.

Learning: Read walkthrough.txt for code details and why_a_hybrid_kalman_filter.txt for motivation and context.
